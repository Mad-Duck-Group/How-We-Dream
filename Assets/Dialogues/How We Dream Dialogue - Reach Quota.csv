Ether,"Hey, newbie. How’s it going?",Left,SandmanBGM
Ether,Just checking in to make sure you're still here.,Left,
Ether,"Looks like your work is going pretty well, isn’t it?",Left,
Ether,"By the way, did you notice? If it's just you and me, there are only two employees in the whole company.",Left,
Ether,"That’s pretty bad, right? There’s no way we can meet our Quota with just two of us. The boss must be struggling.",Left,
Ether,"I even told him that he should consider doing something else. If we keep this up, we’re doomed.",Left,
Sandman,Doomed to what exactly?,Right,
Ether,"Whoa! Boss, you scared me. What are you doing here?",Left,
Sandman,Just here to listen to you two gossip about my company.,Right,
Ether,"Sorry, boss.",Left,
Sandman,I get it. You're right about what you said.,Right,
Sandman,But we’ve just made some changes.,Right,
Ether,Changes? Like what?,Left,
Sandman,Take a look at this. It's the weekly performance report.,Right,
Sandman,"Each day has a set Quota. If we don’t hit the target for the day, it rolls over to the next.",Right,
Sandman,That's why our latest Quota requires us to produce 120 bottles.,Right,
Ether,"Haha, not really surprised.",Left,
Sandman,"The point is, newbie, you managed to meet the Quota!",Right,
Ether,What? Really?,Left,
Sandman,"Yes, you did. How did you manage that all by yourself?",Right,
Ether,"Ahem... Actually, I helped too, boss.",Left,
Sandman,"Yeah, but the report shows that most of the output came from the newbie. Or were you slacking off?",Right,
Ether,"Uh, I think I’m hungry. I’ll go grab something to eat. Bye.",Left,
Sandman,"Hey, you...",Left,
Sandman,"Anyway, thank you for helping me and the company survive another week.",Left,
Sandman,"I believe that with you, me, and Ether working together, we can bring this company back to its glory days.",Left,
Sandman,"I'm counting on you, newbie. Keep up the good work!",Left,
